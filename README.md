## UX
---
### **Strategy**

Target users are:

1. Aged 25-65
2. Individuals looking for maintenance of overall wellbeing and incorporating massage therapy as part of a healthy lifestyle.
3. People looking for massage as means of relaxation and stress relief
4. Individuals looking for massage therapy to deal with particular physical ailments, pain and muscular discomfort
5. People with regular or high intensity physical activity looking for a massage as a tool for muscle recovery and injury prevention
6. Expectant mothers looking for prenatal massage

### **Scope**

1. Easy to find information, easy website navigation
2. Inspirational photographs 
3. Guidance on different types of massage therapy and cost
4. Convenient way of communicating and getting in touch 

The website offers all these things and is easy to use and navigate through.
Given the age group of users the website is likely to be viewed on different screen sizes hence importance of the website responsiveness.


### **Structure** 
 
This is a three-page website to allow desired information to fit. It has navigation bar at the top which allows users to access different parts of the website.
I tried to mix pieces of information with images to aid better visual experience.
The drop-down treatment menu is used to prevent information overload at first glance and also save space on mobile screens. It allows immediate basic information uptake with an option of going into more detail if required. Different layout is used for larger screens to make use of available space.

### **Skeleton**

![Wireframes](docs/wireframes)

The website differs from created wireframes. Once created the treatments and home page looked bare so I decided to add more images and content, and change the layout for better visual experience. The feedback from friends and family also influenced the changes.

### **Surface**

I chose colour palette based around beige/brown tones as I find those colours being calm, warm and comforting that suit business idea of relaxation and stress relief. I chose black color text to allow appropriate contrast. I used Google fonts DM Sans and DM Serif Display.
I felt DM Serif Display provides for a touch of luxury and DM Sans complements DM Serif Display and allows for easy read.

---

## **Features**

 This is a fully responsive website that was designed mobile-first as many people would use mobiles to view
 it. First page is divided into two sections and the other two pages just have one section. The background colour with opacity has been used to provide contrast to cover-text and images. I used DM Serif Display for all of the headings and DM Sans Serif for the body text. This allows for cohesive design throughout the website.

### *Navbar*

The navbar is positioned on the top of the page, the menu collapses into a hamburger icon for space saving on mobile screens. The navigation bar is fully responsive with links to Home, Treatments and Contact pages. This allows the user to easily navigate from page to page.

### *Home*

![Home page](docs/homepage.png)

This is an introduction of the service provider where he shares his path to being a massage therapist. It also mentions therapist's qualifications. I used H2 and H3 elements followed by three paragraphs and an image of the therapist. This page also has a testimonials section.

### *Treatments*

This page has a treatment menu which has information about types of treatment and prices. I used Details element for a mobile screen layout. It allows to see information at a glance and then read more about the treatments when clicking the arrow. I used a table to organise pricing information for treatment bundles.
I have changed the layout for larger screens to make use of the space and provide better visual user experience.

### *Contact*

This is a contact form which allows a user to send an enquiry. The form uses 2 text inpits, an email input, textarea element and a send button.

### *Features left to implement*

I would like to add online booking, payment feature and cancellation policy.
